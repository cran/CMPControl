Description: The main purpose of this package is to juxtapose the different control limits obtained by modelling a data set through the COM-Poisson distribution vs. the classical Poisson distribution. Accordingly, this package offers the ability to compute the COM-Poisson parameter estimates and plot associated Shewhart control charts for a given data set.
